# My ZSA Moonlander config

This serves mostly as a text-based backup of my firmware configuration for my [ZSA Moonlander keyboard](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/).

It's not intended to be built directly from this repo; it's simply a mirror of the source code from [my layout in ZSA's Oryx configurator](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/XE4RP).

Maybe one day I'll get this buildable from this repo. Maybe not.
